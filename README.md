# Simple-A8086-Parser-Compiler
This program illustrates how to parse a simple code written in a language 
which has a known and very simple syntax/semantics. After you run the program
it will give an output code which is written in assembly language of Intel 
A8086 processor. By passing that output to another program designed to compile 
A8086 Assembly you can take the output of your program.
